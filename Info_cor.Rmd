## Manual
For general information on this shiny app, click the right-most tab 'Info' at the top of this app. 

## Options 

- **ICC or Standard deviation:** Choose to manipulate the intra-class correlations or standard deviations of variables X and Y (see below).

- **Within-person correlation:** Change the value of the within-person correlation.
- **Between-person correlation:** Change the value of the between-person correlation.
- **N for plot:** Change the sample size for the scatter plots. Does not affect the value of the depicted correlations, as these are all population values.

***ICC option chosen:***
- **ICC of X; ICC of Y:** Change the intra-class correlation of variable X or Y respectively. The ICC is the the proportion of between-person variance to the total variance for that variable.

***SD option chosen:***
- **Within-person sd of X; of Y; Between-person sd of X, of Y:** Change the values of the standard deviations of either the within- or between-level variables for variable X or Y.


## Results

### Between-person Correlation (top-left) 
The between-person correlation indicates whether a person that has a relatively high/low mean on X compared to other persons, also has a relatively high/low mean on Y compared to other persons. 

At the top of the scatter plot the true value of the between correlation is displayed (chosen by the user).

The data points in this plot are the the expected values for variables X and Y of different persons. That is, if we were to track the scores of a person over time for variables X and Y, then the two means of those scores (one for X and one for Y) are depicted as one datapoint in the scatter plot.

### Within-person Correlation (top-right) 
The within-level correlation indicates whether a person that currently has a relatively high/low score for X compared to their average score, also tends to have a relatively high/low score for Y compared to their average score. We assume here for simplicity that the within-person correlation is equal for all persons.

At the top of the scatter plot the true value of the within correlation is displayed (chosen by the user).

The data points in this plot are the scores for X and Y of one person at different points in time.

### Cross-sectional Correlation (bottom)
The cross-sectional correlation that would result given the specified within-person and between-person correlations and ICCs/standard deviations. 

This correlation indicates, for one point in time, whether persons that have a relatively high/low scores for X compared to other persons, also tend to have a relatively high/low scores for Y compared to other persons. 

At the top of the scatter plot the true value of the cross-sectional correlation is displayed (this is the population value, and hence is not impacted by sampling errors).

The data points in the scatter plot (depicted in purple) are scores of different persons - each person has their own data point - for variables X and Y at one specific time point (a cross-sectional design). Their purple color turns more towards red, or more towards blue, depending on whether the correlation is closer to the between or within correlation respectively.
